# DATA5322---Homework-1 (Updated)

This repository contains the code, outputs, and presentation materials for resubmitting Practical Homework 1 of DATA 5322 (Statistical Learning). 

## Contents
- **Homework1_MarkDaza_Updated.Rmd**: Updated code and model implementation and optimization using tree, bagging, random forest, and boosting.

  Note: The section of code that was updated is labeled in the notebook. Updates include optimization of parameters for Random Forest
  and Boosting methods used for the Regression model.
- **Homework1_MarkDaza_Updated.html**: An HTML version of the notebook allows the grader to visualize the code without the need to run it.
- **202500423_YouthData_Updated.pdf**: Final presentation slide deck. Slides that were modified say (Updated) as part of the slide title.

  Note: Slides now include a theoretical background slide. Variables in the plots used were renamed to be plain language to ease
  understanding. Model result numbers were updated in all slides. Additionally, wording on slides was updated for consistency throughout
  presentation.
